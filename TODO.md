Next Tasks:
1. Fail gracefully when API returns 500
2. Show the right totals in the progress bar in the website when syncing, right now shows '?'. Potentially get complete list of IDs first before processing.
3. Configure log levels, INFO only stdout and errors to file. DEBUG throws everything into stdout and errors to file
